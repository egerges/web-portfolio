                    Adonis is a Lebanese pop-rock band renowned for its signature Arabic lyrics and blistering live performances. The four-piece was formed in 2011 by Anthony Adonis (vocals, keys) and Joey Abou Jawdeh (guitar). The pair, who met during their architecture studies at the American University of Beirut, were later joined by Nicola Hakim on drums and Gio Fikany on bass guitar.
                    <br>
                    The band first came into sight with its debut single “Stouh Adonis” (2012), a dance tune relaying tales of night-time adventures on the rooftops of the group’s small suburban town, and captured the hearts of an avid and devoted fan base.
                    <br>
                    Adonis has since performed at major venues and independent festivals across the Arab world, such as the Carthage International Festival (Tunisia), the Baalbeeck International Festival (Lebanon), the Amman Roman Amphitheatre (Jordan), and Dubai’s Step Music Festival (UAE), releasing five studio albums, and writing music for UNICEF, Netflix, Pepsi, Lipton, Brazil’s Globo TV, and the Lebanese Ministry of Tourism.
                    <br>
                    Produced by Jean-Marie Riachi, the band’s third album “Nour” (2017) consecrated Adonis as a leading player in the Arabic independent music scene, after achieving its first breakthrough with the album’s lead single “Eza Shi Nhar”. In July 2019, Adonis launched its fourth album “12 Sa’a” and kicked off its first European tour. Two years later, after the release of its critically-acclaimed fifth studio album “A’da” (2021), the band played two milestone concerts at the Beirut Hippodrome and on the Dubai 2020 Expo Jubilee Stage, and performed three sold-out shows at Paris’ Arab World Institute.
                    <br>
                    The band’s lead singer Anthony Adonis has written and produced music for leading independent Lebanese artists such as Hiba Tawaji, Aziz Maraka and Dana Hourani, amongst others.
                    <br>
                    Adonis released its sixth studio album “Hadis El Layl” (Night Talks) on November 15, 2022.
